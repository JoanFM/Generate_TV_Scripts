    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

Maybe if I were to generate paragraphs from a book it would make sense to have a larger number. For the number of epochs I tried 20 but I got close from the goal so I decided to move to 30 because the error was getting slowly down. I tried a learning rate of 0.01 but the error was oscillating a lot. For the hidden dimension I chose a value of 350 so it is larger than the embedding dimension chose 300. The number of layers of LSTM is set to 2 becuase 2 or 3 made sense."
